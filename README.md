## 🌦️ Power BI Real-Time Weather & Air Quality Dashboard

In this project, I developed an interactive Weather & Air Quality Dashboard using Power BI, providing real-time insights into environmental conditions for informed decision-making. The dashboard simulates a city-level weather monitoring system with clean, responsive visuals.

### ✅ **Key Features:**

* **Current Weather Overview:**

  * Displays real-time temperature, weather condition (e.g., Partly Cloudy).
  * Live metrics: Visibility, Humidity, UV Index, Pressure, Precipitation, and Wind Speed.
  * Multi-city temperature toggles (e.g., Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai).

* **Forecast Module:**

  * 7-day temperature forecast with trend line visual.
  * Sunrise & Sunset timings for the selected city.
  * Rain prediction with daily percentage likelihood.

* **Air Quality Insights:**

  * Live Air Quality Index (AQI) with health status indicators:

    * Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy, Hazardous.
  * Pollutant breakdown including:

    * PM10, PM2.5, CO, O3, NO2 levels.
  * Health suggestions based on AQI (e.g., "Air is clean and healthy", "Avoid outdoor activity").

* **Real-Time Last Updated Display:**

  * Dynamic "Last Updated" timestamp reflecting data refresh time or system time.

### 💻 **Technologies Used:**

* Power BI (DAX, Visualizations, Data Modeling)
* Custom DAX for AQI Classification & Health Suggestions
* Date-Time Handling with `NOW()` and Source `last_updated` fields
* Card Visuals, Line Charts, Gauges, KPI Indicators

### 🎯 **Business Relevance:**

This dashboard replicates real-world weather and environmental monitoring solutions for:

✔️ Public health awareness
✔️ Travel and event planning decisions
✔️ Pollution tracking and city-level environmental management
